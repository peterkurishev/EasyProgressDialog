    /* ProgressDialog - simple generic progress dialog
     * 
     * Generic progress dialog, displaying items as they occur and receiving only 
     * simple messages for updates.
     * 
     * Advantage: easy to add incremental cancellable work handling without mixing 
     * specific business logic and UI code. The business logic only needs to be aware 
     * of this single generic UI class, with a single line of code at every progress 
     * checkpoint.
     * 
     * There are two methods that can be called within the "work" code (when there is 
     * a progress dialog object present):
     * 
     * Worker_IncrementProgress(string currentAction)
     *   - sets the "current action" area of the dialog with the provided text (if 
     *       set), and increments the progress by 1. If this looks like it will reach
     *       the maximum, then it increments the maximum (so you never reach the end
     *       of the progress bar by calling this).
     * 
     * Worker_SetSpecificProgress(string currentAction, int currentCount, int totalEstimatedCount)
     *   - allows you to adjust the overall estimate. This is useful if you learn 
     *       more about the work to be done as you do it, or if you have no information
     *       on which to base your estimate when you originally bring up the dialog.
     * 
     * You can also change the dialog preferences at any time, they will only 
     * actually "kick in" at the next progress update - in this manner all exposed
     * properties are safe to be called from the Worker Thread (whatever is called 
     * from the "Do Work" method passed in).
